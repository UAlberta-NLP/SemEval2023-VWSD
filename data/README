Task: Given a potentially ambiguous word and some limited textual context, the task is to select among a set of ten candidate images the one which corresponds to the intended meaning of the target word.

This package contains the trial data for the SemEval-2023 Task-1 V-WSD task.

This dataset contains a folder named "all_images", and two files, with the same number of lines (each line corresponds to an instance):

    * (trial).data.txt: This is a tab-separated file containing the following items: 

        target_word <tab> full_phrase <tab> image_1 <tab> image_2 <tab> ... <tab> image_10

	    - "target_word": the potentially ambiguous target word.

   	    - "full_phrase": limited textual context containing the target_word.

            - "image_i": corresponds to the "i"th image. In this version all images are in the all_images folder. 


    * (trial).gold.txt: This file contain the gold labels. Each line contains the name of the gold image.
